      "The arc of the life line deﬁnes the root of the thumb, which is the mount of the Sun, the reservoir of our vitality. The larger the arc, the stronger that person’s natural physical reserves—the tanks are full, and the owner has a deep well of energy, stamina, and enthusiasm to share with the world. The depth of the life line describes the quality of our physical vitality, the conduit of our energy out into the world. A deep life line indicates that the owner has a powerful ability to express her energy, and every opportunity to live a long and successful life. She may be impatient with lesser mortals who tire more easily, and be inclined to pour all that energy into her temperament or temper. To balance: Some of this vitality can be worked out physically, and it would be a good idea to cultivate patience, as well as empathy with those gifted with subtler energy.",

The length of the head line does not show how intelligent we are but the breadth of our interests. Its arc and depth describe the power and attitude of the mind. ",
    paragraph3:
      "A straight and level head line shows a level headed person, who is keen on common sense and logical evidence, and less interested in theory or exploring alternatives. This person will be interested in science, a structured and practical profession, or one that follows a time-honoured tradition. Our emotional lives are complex, and not deﬁned by one line. We can’t look at a hand and tell from the lines if its owner will be happily married to a black-haired stranger by the age of 36. But reading the hand can help you to know what to do with your one wild and precious heart, and maximize the potential for comfortable and easy relationships."
