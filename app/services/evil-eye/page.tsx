    paragraph1:
      "The Evil Eye, or “Drishti”, is a harmful gaze that brings misfortune, jealousy, or sickness. In astrology, it’s seen as a negative energy that can disrupt one’s aura and lead to discomfort, misfortune, or even illness. While not a literal eye, it represents the negative energy projected onto someone, potentially impacting their physical, emotional, mental, and even spiritual well-being.",

    paragraph2:
      "It often comes from those who unconsciously or consciously emit negative energy due to envy. Every culture has a different definition of this term. While skeptics may doubt it, many eventually believe due to personal experiences.",
    paragraph3:
      "This ancient belief has roots in many cultures and is recognized in Vedic astrology. Various treatises in Vedic Astrology mention envy and evil eye influences, though interpretations can vary.",
