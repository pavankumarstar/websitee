      "Family issues may include misunderstandings, disrespect, or a lack of emotional connection. Astrology can offer insights into the roots of family conflicts by analyzing planetary positions and aspects in birth charts, potentially revealing underlying tensions and patterns. Specifically, Vedic astrology examines houses related to family (2nd, 4th, 7th) and their lords, looking for afflictions from malefic planets like Saturn, Rahu, Ketu, and Mars, which can indicate misunderstandings and quarrels.",

    paragraph2:
      "Ego clashes and generational gaps often cause emotional distance. Family is the foundation of our lives. But when issues arise—be it between parents and children, husband and wife, in-laws, or siblings—it affects everyone’s mental and emotional well-being. These problems often start small but grow bigger over time due to misunderstandings, ego clashes, jealousy, or external influences like financial stress or black magic.",

    paragraph1:
      "Planetary positions, especially Moon, Mars, and Rahu, can cause disharmony in families. Negative influences on the 4th house, representing family, or the Moon, symbolizing emotions, can lead to discord. Malefic planets like Saturn, Mars, Rahu, and Ketu can also trigger conflicts. Pitra Dosh, an ancestral influence, may manifest as ongoing health issues, financial instability, or emotional distress within the family.",

    paragraph2:
      "Weak 4th house or presence of doshas in the family chart leads to emotional breakdown. Family is the cornerstone of our lives, the place where we seek love, support, and a sense of belonging. However, family problems are an inevitable part of life, and they can sometimes leave us feeling lost and overwhelmed.",
    paragraph3:
      "Timing of specific phases (like Sade Sati) also intensifies family tensions. The sun sign represents an individual’s core personality. Understanding each family member’s sun sign can provide insight into their basic characteristics and tendencies.",
